## Homework
This course includes programming assignments through which students will learn how to design
and implement program analyzers.
We will use Github/Github Classroom to provide skeleton code and manage submissions.
Make sure you have a Github account and get the [student developer pack benefits](https://education.github.com/pack).
Moreover, student should get familiar with `git`.
If you are new to `git`, see this [book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).
Students will use the [OCaml](https://ocaml.org) programming language for the assignments.

- [Commercial Users of Functional Programming](http://cufp.org/2017)
- [OCaml for the Masses](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2038036)
- [Why OCaml](https://blog.janestreet.com/why-ocaml/)
- [Why Functional Programming Matters](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1093/comjnl/32.2.98) [<img src="youtube_social_icon_red.png" width="16" />](https://youtu.be/1qBHf8DrWR8)

All submissions will be managed using Github.
For each assignment, a unique invitation URL for Github Classroom will be posted at [KLMS](http://klms.kaist.ac.kr).
Once you accept the invitation, a private repository for your assignment will be created.
You can push as many commits as you want before the deadline. We will grade the final commit of your `master` branch.

The late homework policy is as follows:
- 80% credit for one day late
- 50% credit for two days late
